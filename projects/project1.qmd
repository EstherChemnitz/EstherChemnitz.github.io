This was a project initiated by the Nordic Council of Ministers, which requested an assessment of the extent of online misogyny and antifeminism in the Nordic countries. It was carried out by the [Centre for Digital Youth Care](https://cfdp.dk/){target="_blank"} and by [Analyse & Tal, f.m.b.a.](https://www.ogtal.dk/){target="_blank"}. I contributed with research on the cognitive aspects that allow some groups to uphold misperceptions as well as the potential effects of attempting to correct their views (see pre-print on this topic under [Publications](https://estherchemnitz.github.io/publications)) I was also a part of the Expert Advisory Board.
