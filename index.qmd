Hello, my name is Esther Chemnitz. I'm a Ph.D. fellow at [the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University](https://ps.au.dk/en/){target="_blank"}, where I work with fantastic colleagues on the research project [ROPH (Research on Online Political Hostility)](https://ps.au.dk/forskning/forskningsprojekter/research-on-online-political-hostility){target="_blank"}.

My academic background is a patchwork with a BA in Media studies, a short detour around political science, and an MA in Cognition and Communication from the University of Copenhagen. I was even a cabinet maker at one point.

What occupies me at the moment is to understand *when* public online conversations are possible from a pragmatic or language-use perspective.


My interest in this topic reflects my academic background. I draw on the cognitive literature on language use and interactive processes in conversation (see eg. [Herbert Clark](https://web.stanford.edu/~clark/){target="_blank"}, Deanna Wilkes Gibbs, [Susan Brennan](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=sGPW9jAAAAAJ&hl=en){target="_blank"}). And on the work of media scholars like [danah boyd](https://www.danah.org/){target="_blank"}, [Alice Marwick](https://datasociety.net/people/marwick-alice/page/1/){target="_blank"}, [Eden Litt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6qVhz2YAAAAJ&hl=en){target="_blank"}, [Ezster Hargittai](https://www.eszter.com/){target="_blank"}, [Joshua Meyrowitz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K2t9ozcAAAAJ&hl=en){target="_blank"}, [Nancy Baym](https://www.nancybaym.com/){target="_blank"} and many others.

I am a strong proponent of interdisciplinarity and I believe that research should be (and inevitably is) a collaborative process. My thoughts and ideas are not created in a vaccuum, rather they are continuously fed by other scholars, by popular culture and from observing the world around me.

I also have two kids under 6 who keep me busy when I am not working.
