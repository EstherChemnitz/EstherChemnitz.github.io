    "text": "Hello, my name is Esther Chemnitz. I’m a Ph.D. fellow at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University, where I work with fantastic colleagues on the research project ROPH (Research on Online Political Hostility).\nMy academic background is a patchwork with a BA in Media studies, a short detour around political science, and an MA in Cognition and Communication from the University of Copenhagen. I was even a cabinet maker at one point.\nWhat occupies me at the moment is to understand when public online conversations are possible from a pragmatic or language-use perspective.\nMy interest in this topic reflects my academic background. I draw on the cognitive literature on language use and interactive processes in conversation (see eg. Herbert Clark, Deanna Wilkes Gibbs, Susan Brennan). And on the work of media scholars like danah boyd, Alice Marwick, Eden Litt, Ezster Hargittai, Joshua Meyrowitz, Nancy Baym and many others.\nI am a strong proponent of interdisciplinarity and I believe that research should be (and inevitably is) a collaborative process. My thoughts and ideas are not created in a vaccuum, rather they are continuously fed by other scholars, by popular culture and from observing the world around me.\nI also have two kids under 6 who keep me busy when I am not working."
